# emojiImages
Turns images gathered from the danbooru API into emoji-versions of themselves

Will need to be loaded as a Processing 3 sketch with the HTTPs requests library enabled.
In order to use Danbooru image gathering, a danbooru username and API key are required. 
These are easy to acquire after creating an account.

Otherwise, enter a filename as the 'toLoad' variable, and the image of that name in the sketch
directory will be converted.

Please credit the author if images created using this tool are to be redistributed.
